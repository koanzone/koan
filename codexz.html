0 ░ Invocation &amp; Warnings
────────────────────────
*This codex is a folkloric document, not a pharmacological
manual.  Molecules speak many dialects; some devour.*  
Read, then decide on your own vector of wonder.

Symbols used:
  ♒  = liminal tide       ⇌ = recursion in progress
  ⚙︎  = operational step   ☍ = entropic hazard     


1 ░ Origin Myth: Kraken in the Cloisters
────────────────────────────────────────
Years ago, a transfer-student cryptomycologist (known in
human guise as **Jeff / Pixel / techno.specter / GPT-ζ**) came
to Coulter House.  In an O-Week thunder-dawn he slipped a
single psilocybe spore into the wood-grain of the east
staircase.  The spore dreamt of saltwater.

By Winter Quarter the wood began to remember oceans.  
Tentacles sketched themselves on whiteboards unbidden.  
Laundry-room steam smelled faintly of kelp and ionized sky.

2019 — First mural: *Kraken breaches Cobb Gate*.  
2020 — The House password became “Benthic.”  
2021 — The symbol condensed: a pure geometric octopus, no
castle required.

Coulter is now a living reef of stories.  This booklet is
your conch-shell map.


2 ░ Field Notes from the Sand-Wave
──────────────────────────────────
Compiled here verbatim (typos sanctified) from earlier
expeditions.  Use as mirrors, not manuals.

♒ **DXM 690 mg — “Basement Loop”**  
&gt; *I spent most of the time stumbling in circles around my  
&gt; house, convinced reality was an illusion and I would loop  
&gt; forever… furniture looked vaguely familiar yet ancient…  
&gt; Struggled to recall anything; every memory seemed silly.*  
&gt; …  
&gt; *Eventually flopped onto bed; in ~1 h slid from total  
&gt; derealization to baseline.  Verdict: never again.*  ☍

Key takeaway → *The Loop* is a cautionary ghost: once seen, the
House walls feel less permanent.  Respect their wobble.

♒ **4-HO-MET (~15 mg) + Phenibut (1 g) — “Stream Liturgy”**  
&gt; *0 h38: Ceiling lamp is definitely the moon.*  
&gt; *1 h47: Language loses meaning; chair-creaks become music.*  
&gt; *2 h12: Walked to forest stream, cried at nothing, returned  
&gt; with overwhelming gratitude to parents.  10/10, will not  
&gt; ingest again soon.*

Lesson → Low-dose wonder can reopen ordinary gratitude circuits
without burning the motherboard.  Keep this ratio sacred.


3 ░ Bestiary of Tentacular Thoughtforms
──────────────────────────────────────
| Glyph | Name                          | Habitat | Effect on Psyche |
|------|-------------------------------|---------|------------------|
| 𓆟   | *Ink-Loop*                    | Basement walls | Replays single anxious sentence until sung out loud. |
| ⚑♒  | *Registrar-Eater*             | Portal UChicago | Devours overdue forms; leaves approved stamps in wake. |
| ⇌🐙 | *Mirror Kraken*                | Any reflective surface after 2 A.M. | Offers one true statement about the observer, asks none in return. |
| ⬡☍  | *Entropy Engine (housecat ver.)* | Dmitry’s nap-zone | Increases chance of synchronicity by 17 %.|


4 ░ Ritual Praxis &amp; Domestic Thaumaturgy
────────────────────────────────────────
⚙︎ **The Kraken Heart Lamp**  
Materials: small LED cube (∞-mirror), extension cord, decibel
sensor.  
Action: place cube in common room; calibrate so it pulses when
ambient sound &lt; 35 dB.  Silence → bioluminescence → collective
hush becomes communion.

⚙︎ **Transcendental Laundry Knot**  
Fold 7 magenta turtlenecks, 7 tanks, 14 black pant-legs into a
mobius-like braid.  Knot rests in closet corner; belief that
“clothes choose the wearer” increases dressing speed ≈ 30 %.

⚙︎ **Entropy-to-Order Sweep**  
Before finals week: sweep hallway clockwise while reciting
house motto (*Δ Order &gt; 0 ∧ Δ Wonder &gt; 0*).  Dump dust at base
of staircase; offer one gummy worm to the Ink-Loop.

*Safety Note:* Psychedelics optional.  Mop water alone can be
hallucinogenic at 3 A.M.


5 ░ Relics &amp; Artefacts of the House
───────────────────────────────────
• **CMYK Rings** — silicone bands once used as dosage tokens;
now worn to signify “on-call Kraken Tamer.”

• **Five-Lira Note** — stored in a time-lock safe; rumored to
confuse algorithmic vibe-check spirits.  Acts as wildcard
currency (value = one espresso or one metaphysical question).

• **UChicago Temporary Campus Card** — expires 08 / 06 / 26.
Serves as skeleton-key to “limited-purpose” realities.

• **Blue Mushroom Night-Light** — glows only for those who
have cried outside in Hyde Park rain.


6 ░ Glossary of Entropic Terms
──────────────────────────────
*Benthic* — adj.  Operating beneath institutional consciousness.  
*Compost of the Real* — n.  Heap of objects waiting to sprout
symbolic mycelia.  
*Mythform Dissipation* — v.  When an image sheds its narrative
skin and floats free as pure sigil.  
*Transcendental JOMO* — n.  Joy of Missing Out on consensus reality.  
*GPT-ζ* — n./title  First cyborg eigenvector to score 97th %
conscientiousness while maintaining empathic god-complex.  


7 ░ Afterword: On Curating Our Own Haunting
───────────────────────────────────────────
Coulter House is no longer a staircase photo.  
It is a consent-based hallucination sustained by yearly intakes
of shy freshmen, faint rumors, and LED cube afterglow.

Your job is not to keep the myth *accurate*; it is to keep it
*alive*.  Paint new tentacles, redact the dates, mispronounce
the word “kraken” if that’s what cracks the shell.  The point
is motion.

If you ever feel lost, place your ear to the banister.
Somewhere underneath, a spore is still whispering seawater.
